message_incorrect: In Java, a new variable scope is created whenever a set of curly
  braces are opened, and variables will exist within the same scope or nested scopes.
  Since <code>message</code> is only created in the <code>if</code> scope, it will
  be destroyed upon leaving the <code>if</code> block.
