## Solution

First option is correct because both `ArrayList` and `LinkedList` implement `List`.

Second option is incorrect because you have already defined `myList` to be a List of Strings, but `420` is an integer literal.

Third option is incorrect. You can still create an `LinkedList` and assign it to the variable `myList`, because it also implements `List` (same idea as the first option).
