Please resize this pane if you cannot read the code properly.

## Question 1

Study the code below.

```java
public class MyProgram {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        List<String> myList = new ArrayList();
        // some other code that follows...
    }
}
```

What is true about the variable `myList` and what I can do with it in the subsequent lines?
